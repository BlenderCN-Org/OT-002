For this experiment you will need borax (disodium tetraborate) and hydrochloric acid plus methanol optional extra. 

First part of the procedure is to make a concentrated solution of borax. I did this by dissolving 7g of borax in 20ml of boiling hot water. To this approximately 20ml of hydrochloric acid was added.
Next the solution was cooled and filtered.

The wet boric acid was then mixed with methanol and set on fire. A blue orange flame was produced that had a slight green tinge to it. 

The last part was to heat the boric acid until it decomposed into boric oxide. Which when molten can be drawn out into long fibers.

Safty :- hydrochloric acid is corrosive and an irritant. Borax can be an irritant to some people with sensitive skin. methanol is toxic and flamable. Always wear gloves and goggles.
